# Launch Announcement Draft

**Subject:** Introducing Love of Food — a donation-powered recipe community

Hello friends,

Today we’re thrilled to launch **Love of Food**, a community-owned space to share recipes, stories, and grocery adventures without ads or algorithmic pressure.

## Why Now?

Food brings people together, yet most online spaces prioritize engagement over connection. Love of Food flips the script: no influencers, no tracking, just thoughtful tools for cooking together.

## What’s Inside

* Recipe journals with ingredient intelligence.
* Shared shopping lists that remember your favorite stores.
* Donation transparency and opt-in telemetry.

## Join Us

With gratitude,
The Love of Food Team
