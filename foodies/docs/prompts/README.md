# Prompt Library

This directory centralizes the primary prompts used when collaborating with AI tooling on the Shared Plate project. Each file adapts the original platform charter to reflect the current architecture and workflows.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `system_prompt.md` | Baseline guardrails for any AI agent interacting with the repository. |
| `feature_prompt.md` | Template for feature implementation or refactoring requests. |
| `documentation_prompt.md` | Template for documentation-only updates. |

Use these prompts as starting points and append task-specific details before initiating an AI-assisted session.
