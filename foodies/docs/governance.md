# Governance Model

Love of Food is community owned. This governance guide documents how decisions are made, how stewards are selected, and how transparency is maintained.

## Roles

* **Stewards** — Elected every 6 months. Responsible for budgeting donations, moderating disputes, and guiding roadmap.
* **Maintainers** — Trusted contributors with merge rights. Accountable for code quality and documentation accuracy.
* **Moderators** — Focused on community safety, content policy enforcement, and supporting appeals.

## Elections

1. Nominations open 30 days before term end.
2. Candidates publish a platform (recorded in `docs/governance.md` revisions).
3. Voting happens using ranked-choice via a secure, audited form. Results are posted to the transparency ledger.

## Transparency Ledger

* Donation inflows and outflows are published monthly in `docs/terms.md` appendix.
* Meeting notes and major decisions are recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`.
* All moderation actions above warning level are logged with anonymized identifiers.

## Decision Making

* Technical proposals follow an RFC process. Drafts live in `docs/rfcs/<id>.md` (directory to be added when needed).
* Stewards seek consensus. If consensus fails, a simple majority vote occurs with results published publicly.

## Conflict Resolution

1. Start with direct conversation between involved parties.
2. Escalate to a moderator if no resolution within 72 hours.
3. Appeal to stewards for final arbitration. Decisions are archived and viewable by members.

## Amendments

This governance document can be amended by a two-thirds steward vote plus community ratification.
