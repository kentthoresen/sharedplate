# Architecture Review - Shared Plate API

## Overview
This document captures the results of a source-level review requested on the current Shared Plate codebase. The review focused on confirming that the service architecture aligns with the intended layered design and that the core application logic is implemented in Rust.

## Rust-First Implementation
* The API service located at `apps/api` is implemented exclusively in Rust, orchestrated through `Cargo.toml` and a Tokio runtime entrypoint (`src/main.rs`).
* Handler modules under `src/handlers` expose REST endpoints via Axum routing. Each file is a Rust module with idiomatic structure and extensive commentary, satisfying the Rust-only core requirement.
* Support modules (`auth`, `errors`, `routes`, `ws`) are authored in Rust and integrated through `mod` declarations in `main.rs`.

## Layered Architecture Verification
* `main.rs` wires configuration, tracing, and router construction only, keeping the entrypoint thin.
* Routing is centralized in `routes::register_routes`, ensuring that handler registration is not intermingled with HTTP server bootstrapping.
* Each handler module contains request/response models and delegates persistence to the `storage` layer. A placeholder `storage` module is present to preserve the architectural seam for the forthcoming SurrealDB integration.
* Authentication logic is isolated under `auth`, ensuring clear separation from HTTP handlers.

## External Interfaces
* The API exposes a `/health` endpoint for readiness checks, implemented via Axum routing.
* WebSocket support lives under the `ws` module, reinforcing the modular design.

## Tooling & Scripts
* Installation and orchestration scripts (e.g., `scripts/install_all.sh`) enforce dependency checks, run sub-installers for both the Rust API and Next.js web client, and capture logs for reproducibility.
* No deviations from the Rust-first policy were found within the server codebase. The Next.js application (`apps/web`) is treated as a separate delivery artifact and does not compromise the Rust requirement for the backend core.

## Follow-up Recommendations
1. Finalize the SurrealDB data access layer by replacing the placeholder `storage` module with concrete repository implementations.
2. Expand automated tests once the database layer lands; current test coverage is limited due to absent persistence.
3. Consider adding CI checks that ensure all backend source files remain Rust-based to guard against regressions.
