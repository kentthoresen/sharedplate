# Love of Food â€” Shared Plate

"Love of Food" (codename: **Shared Plate**) is an open, donation-funded platform for sharing recipes, cooking stories, and community-led shopping lists. This repository contains the full stack implementation, including a Rust-first backend, SurrealDB-powered social graph, and a Next.js experience for both marketing pages and the logged-in application. All code is heavily documented so that new contributors can be productive on day one.

## Getting Started (TL;DR)

1. Ensure you have Rust (latest stable), Node.js 20+, pnpm, Docker, and SurrealDB CLI available.
2. Copy every `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in provider secrets.
3. Run the orchestrated installer: `./scripts/install_all.sh`.
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` for the web app and `http://localhost:8080` for the API health endpoint.

## Architecture Review Summary

An April 2024 audit verified that the backend adheres to the intended layered Axum architecture and that all core services are implemented in Rust. The write-up, including recommended follow-up items, is available in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md).
