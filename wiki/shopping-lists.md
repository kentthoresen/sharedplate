# Shopping Lists

## Creating a List

1. Open **Lists** in the app.
2. Click **New List**, add a name, and optionally invite collaborators by email.
3. Import ingredients from your saved recipes or add manual items.

## Smart Reordering

* When visiting a store, enable **Store Memory** and select a store alias.
* As you check off items, the sequence is recorded.
* On your next visit, the list reorders to match the previous trip.

## Sharing

* Collaborators receive email invites and in-app notifications.
* Shared users can add items, leave notes, and mark items complete.
