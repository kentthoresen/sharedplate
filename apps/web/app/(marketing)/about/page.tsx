      <p>
        Love of Food started in community kitchens and neighborhood potlucks. We wanted a space online that mirrored those
        collaborative, caring environments without ads or influencer hierarchies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform is stewarded by volunteers across continents, built with open source tools, and sustained by donations from
        members like you.
