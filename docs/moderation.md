# Moderation Guidelines

Our moderation approach prioritizes education and restorative practices. These guidelines support moderators and community members alike.

## Values

* Encourage collaboration and constructive feedback.
* Protect marginalized communities from harm.

## Prohibited Content

* Hate speech, harassment, or discrimination.
* Graphic violence without context or warnings.
* Spam, scams, or commercial solicitation.
* Copyright infringement or plagiarism.

## Enforcement Ladder

1. **Community Reminder** — Friendly note pointing to guidelines.
2. **Warning** — Documented message, logged in moderation tracker.
3. **Timeout** — Temporary suspension (24 hours to 7 days).
4. **Removal** — Indefinite suspension with option to appeal.

## Appeals Process

* Users submit appeals via `support@sharedplate.community` within 30 days.
* Moderators review context and evidence with stewards.
* Decisions are communicated within 14 days and recorded in the transparency ledger.

## Tools

## Support Resources
